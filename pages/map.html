        <p id="bigPara">The man-made Treasure Island was originally conceived as the future home of San Francisco’s first airport, a hub for the new China Clipper service from Pan American World Airways (Pan Am).  Instead, the island’s first event was the Golden Gate International Exposition 1939-1940. The worlds’ fair celebrated "A Pageant of the Pacific", as well as the completion of the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges.</p>

            <p id="smallPara">Over the next 80 years, without a complete redo as planned, the island’s historic buildings might be flooded or even lost to San Francisco’s rising Bay. However, the Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA), a government agency, has comprehensive plans for protecting the place and its historic buildings from sea level rise (SLR).</p>
            <p id="smallPara">In the first phase of reconstruction, now in progress, the perimeter of the island around the historic buildings is being elevated to withstand 16” of sea level rise relative to the 2000 level.  Plans are in place for higher levels of SLR as well.  For example, at 30 inches of SLR, an adaptive management plan for 36 inches will be triggered to allow time to build more improvements.</p>

The fair closed its second season at the end of September in 1940. Germany had already destroyed thousands of Jewish businesses and deported tens of thousands of Jews to concentration camps.  As Hitler had also invaded Poland in 1939, war chatter was everywhere, so instead of a commercial airport, the U.S. Navy took over Treasure Island. (Treasure Island Museum,1939)</p>

In this act of war,  the Empire of Japan attacked the American town by air and sea. Japan's goal was to annihilate the entire U.S. Pacific Fleet, docked at its base on Oahu, Hawaii.  The day after, on December 8 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave his "Day of Infamy" speech and the U.S. Congress declared war on Japan, in effect entering World War II on all fronts. </p>

            <p id="smallPara">Treasure Island, like other parts of the west coast, the U.S. and world, is threatened by earthquakes as well as SLR.  To address both challenges, in 2016 the developers embarked upon a large geotechnical reengineering of the island.</p>
            <p id="smallPara"> The process seeks two outcomes – one, to fortify the land in case of a large seismic and/or flood event and two, to minimize long-term settlement of land above and below sea level to protect new buildings and infrastructure.</p>

            <p class="caption">The geotechnical measures being taken to stabilize Treasure Island are massive and transformative. The sandy fill that created the Island in 1937 could liquefy in a major earthquake.  And major earthquakes bring major waves and flooding that could further destabilize the land. The risk of major flood events increase along with sea level rise. What's more, the soft muddy clay resting on the seabed beneath the fill is watery and compressible, so currently heavy or even light structures on the surface tend to sink. (Engeo, 2019)</p>

            <p id="smallPara">Fourth, after the topsoil is prepared by the tamper, a large, temporary fill, referred to as a surcharge, is placed on the surface.  Surcharges, sometimes in excess of 20 feet high, are heavier than planned buildings and any other future load (soil, plants, pavement and so on) planned for the site. The purpose of the surcharge is to squeeze the compressible Bay mud, so that its excess water will seep up through the wick drains and be dispersed through the sand and shoal strata.</p>
            <p id="smallPara">This process allows future buildings and soil to be placed on the surface without significant sinking, also known as settlement.  Typically, when the surcharge is removed, about one-third of it is left in place to reach the required finish elevation of the ground. Raised surfaces are another built adaptation to address sea level rise.</p>
