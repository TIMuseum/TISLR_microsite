Instead, the island’s first event was the Golden Gate International Exposition 1939-1940. The world's fair celebrated "A Pageant of the Pacific", as well as the completion of the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges.</p>

            <p id="smallPara">Over the next 80 years, without a complete redo as planned, the island’s historic buildings might be flooded or even lost to San Francisco’s rising Bay. However, the Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA), a government agency, has comprehensive plans for protecting the place and its historic buildings from sea level rise (SLR).</p>
            <p id="smallPara">In the first phase of reconstruction, now in progress, the perimeter of the island around the historic buildings is being elevated to withstand 16” of sea level rise relative to the 2000 level.  Plans are in place for higher levels of SLR as well.  For example, at 30 inches of SLR, an adaptive management plan for 36 inches will be triggered to allow time to build more improvements.</p>

As Hitler had also invaded Poland in 1939, war chatter was everywhere, so instead of a commercial airport, the U.S. Navy took over Treasure Island. (Treasure Island Museum,1939)</p>

It was occupied for thousands of years by visiting bands of indigenous Chochenyo speaking Ohlone people before being colonized by the Spanish and deeded in the early 18th Century to the Isidro de Castros. The Castro's descendants became one of the largest Californio families--Californians of Spanish descent. (It was several hundred years before its neighbor-island was built and peopled.)</p>
        <p id="smallPara">The U.S. Coast Guard will remain indefinitely on the portion of the island south and west of the freeway. In the redevelopment, the largest, most desirable units will be on Yerba Buena Island. One condo building is scheduled for completion in 2022.  The Treasure Island Development Authority (TIDA) plans parks, walkways, trails and bike paths -- all favored over the roads -- to connect the two islands.</p>

            <p id="smallPara">The war ended after the Americans dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan.  A few days later, the Japanese surrendered, on August 14,1945.  The world war had lasted six years.  Between 70 and 85 million people were killed, mostly civilians, and many more were injured, sickened and displaced.</p>
            <p id="smallPara">Among the dead were six million European Jews, systematically exterminated by Nazi Germany and its allies.  Millions of other Europeans deemed subhuman by the Nazis were also murdered.  This group included Slavs, ethnic Poles, Roma, gay men, and political and religous opponents of the regime.</p>

            <p id="smallPara"> The process seeks two outcomes – one, to fortify the land in case of a large seismic and/or flood event and two, to minimize long-term settlement of land above and below sea level to protect new buildings and infrastructure.</p>

            <p class="caption">The geotechnical measures being taken to stabilize Treasure Island are massive.  The sandy fill that created the Island in 1937 could liquefy in a major earthquake.  And major earthquakes bring major waves and flooding that could further destabilize the land. The risk of major flood events increase along with sea level rise, even without seismic activity.  What's more, the soft muddy clay resting on the seabed beneath the fill is watery and compressible, so currently heavy or even light structures on the surface tend to sink.  (Engeo, 2019)</p>

Surcharges, sometimes in excess of 20 feet high, are heavier than planned buildings and any other future load (soil, plants, pavement and so on) planned for the site. The purpose of the surcharge is to squeeze the compressible Bay mud, so that its excess water will seep up through the wick drains and be dispersed through the sand and shoal strata.</p>

The rich majority is likely to mirror the tech sector, Asian and White.  Will White and Asian young adults mix with Black and Brown parents and their young children? There will be a new public school system on the island, so that every local child can have a place from pre-k through high school.</p>
